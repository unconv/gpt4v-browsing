            "content": "# GPT4 Vision Web Crawling\nThis is a GPT4 Vision API and Puppeteer powered tool that can answer questions based on website screenshots. You ask it a question and it will browse to a website and take a screenshot. Then it will use GPT4 Vision API to answer the question based on the screenshot.\n## JavaScript version\nThe JavaScript version (`vision_crawl.js`) is able to not only open a URL directly, but it can also click on links on pages.\n```shell\n$ npm install\n$ node vision_crawl.js\n```\n## Python version\nThe Python version (`vision_crawl.py`) is the original version, that only opens one URL at a time directly. The Python version uses JavaScript too, for the Puppeteer part.\n```shell\n$ npm install\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n$ python3 vision_crawl.py\n```\n## Examples\nYou can ask stuff like this, for example:\n- \"What is the weather like in California?\"\n- \"What are the latest news in the world?\"\n- \"What is the current stock price of Tesla?\"\n- \"How many subscribers does Unconventional Coding have on YouTube?\""
